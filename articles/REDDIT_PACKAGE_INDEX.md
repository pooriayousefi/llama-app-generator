## üéì Expected Questions - Quick Reference

Have these answers ready:

| Question | Short Answer |
|----------|--------------|
| Why CRTP? | Zero overhead, type safety, full inlining - 28% faster |
| Why not CMake? | Python is simpler for cross-platform, but PRs welcome |
| Compile times? | 10-30 sec first time (header parsing), then fast |
| Why Apache 2.0? | Patent protection, namespace preservation, corporate-friendly |
| Over-engineered? | For production apps needing architecture, not quick scripts |
| AI assistance? | Yes, Claude 4.5 - I believe in transparency |
| Works with OpenAI? | Could modify LlamaClient, architecture stays same |
| Thread safety? | Per-request threads, share state with mutexes as usual |
| Windows support? | WSL works, native MSVC not extensively tested |
