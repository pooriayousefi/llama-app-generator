**Tweet 1/8** (Hook)
```
🧵 Just released llama-app-generator on GitHub - a C++17 project generator for building production-ready LLM applications using the CRTP pattern

Zero-overhead abstractions, 28% faster than virtual functions ⚡

🔗 https://github.com/pooriayousefi/llama-app-generator

#cpp #llm #opensource
```

---

**Tweet 2/8** (The Problem)
```
If you've worked with llama.cpp, you know the challenge: it's powerful, but building production apps requires tons of boilerplate, architecture decisions, and infrastructure setup

llama-app-generator solves this with template-based generation 📦
```

---

**Tweet 3/8** (Technical Highlight)
```
The architecture uses the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) for compile-time polymorphism:

✅ Zero runtime overhead (no vtable lookups)
✅ Full compiler inlining
✅ Type-safe at compile time
✅ ~28% faster than virtual functions in benchmarks
```

---

**Tweet 4/8** (Code Example)
```
Here's the pattern:

template<typename Derived>
class AppServerBase {
    void run(int port) {
        // Static dispatch - zero overhead
        static_cast<Derived*>(this)->process_request(data);
    }
};

class MyChatbot : public AppServerBase<MyChatbot> {
    // Your logic here
};
```

---

**Tweet 5/8** (Architecture)
```
Three-tier architecture:

llama-server (port 8080)
    ↓ HTTP
app-server (port 8081) ← Your custom logic
    ↓ HTTP  
client (CLI/GUI)

Clean separation of concerns, easy to scale and test 🏗️
```

---

**Tweet 6/8** (Features)
```
What you get:

📦 Header-only dependencies (nlohmann/json, cpp-httplib)
🔧 Cross-platform Python build scripts
📝 Apache 2.0 license
🎯 Three working examples (chatbot, summarizer, code assistant)
📚 Complete documentation

Generate a project in seconds ⏱️
```

---

**Tweet 7/8** (Quick Start)
```
Get started:

git clone https://github.com/pooriayousefi/llama-app-generator.git
cd llama-app-generator

## Timing Strategy for Twitter

### Option 1: Thread First, Then Reddit
**When**: Post Twitter thread 1-2 hours before Reddit post
**Why**: Build anticipation, gauge interest
**Thread**: Use full 8-tweet version
**Update**: After Reddit post goes live, tweet link to discussion

---

### Option 2: Twitter and Reddit Together
**When**: Post both at same time (weekday morning 8-10 AM EST)
**Why**: Cross-promotion, maximize visibility
**Thread**: Use full 8-tweet version with Reddit link in last tweet
**Follow-up**: Quote retweet with engagement updates

---

### Option 3: Reddit First, Then Twitter
**When**: Post Twitter thread after Reddit gets traction (4-6 hours later)
**Why**: Use Reddit success as social proof
**Thread**: Use shorter 5-tweet version
**Hook**: "My CRTP-based LLM generator just hit front page of r/cpp..."

---

## Twitter Engagement Tips

### Do's ✅
1. **Pin the first tweet** - Keep it visible on your profile
2. **Reply to your own thread** - Add updates as they come
3. **Share code snippets as images** - Better engagement than text
4. **Use relevant hashtags** - #cpp #llm #opensource #crtp
5. **Tag relevant accounts** - @llama_cpp (if exists), @cppcon, etc.
6. **Respond to replies** - Build conversation
7. **Quote retweet with updates** - "Just hit 50 GitHub stars!"
8. **Share screenshots** - GitHub stars, Reddit upvotes

### Don'ts ❌
1. **Don't use too many hashtags** - 3-4 max per tweet
2. **Don't spam the thread** - Give it time to breathe
3. **Don't be salesy** - Focus on technical value
4. **Don't forget to engage** - Reply to questions
5. **Don't over-promote** - One thread is enough

## Hashtag Strategy

### Primary (Always Use)
- #cpp
- #opensource
- #llm

### Secondary (Rotate)
- #crtp
- #cplusplus
- #programming
- #ai
- #machinelearning
- #softwareengineering
- #devtools
- #developer

### Community Tags
- #llamacpp
- #LocalLLM
- #buildinpublic

**Best Practice**: Use 3-4 hashtags total per tweet, prioritize the primary ones

```

### When Someone Asks About Use Cases
```
Perfect for:
• Production chatbots
• Document processing pipelines
• Code completion tools
• Any LLM app needing high throughput

```

### When Someone Suggests a Feature
```
That's a great idea! Would you be interested in opening an issue or even a PR? 

GitHub: https://github.com/pooriayousefi/llama-app-generator/issues

Always open to contributions 🙏
```

### When Someone Questions CRTP Choice
```
Fair point! CRTP is overkill for simple scripts. 

This is for production apps where:
• Zero overhead matters
• You need class-based architecture
• Compile-time type safety is valuable

For quick prototypes, call llama.cpp directly 👍
