## AI Development Assistant

This project was developed with assistance from **Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Preview)**, an AI assistant that contributed to:

- Architecture design and three-tier system design
- CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) implementation
- Code generation and template development
- Cross-platform Python build scripts
- Comprehensive documentation and README files
- Apache 2.0 licensing and namespace protection strategy
- API design and HTTP endpoint structure

The AI assistant helped accelerate development and ensure best practices in modern C++17 design patterns, licensing, and documentation.

## Third-Party Libraries

## Special Thanks

- The C++ community for CRTP and template metaprogramming patterns
- The open-source community for header-only libraries
- Anthropic for developing Claude, making AI-assisted development possible
- Everyone who contributes to llama.cpp and the LLM ecosystem
